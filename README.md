have shown signs of mental illness. It provides housing and supervision of teenagers who are
making the transition from psychiatric hospitals back into the community. Because many of
the teenagers were severely abused as children and have been involved with the juvenile
justice system, behavioral problems are common at New Life. Employee pay is low and staff
turnover (attrition) is high.A reengineering program wasinstituted at New Life with the goals of lowering behavioral
problems of the kids and decreasing employee turnover rates.

incidence behavioral problems and staff turnover. i.e To determine if the reengineering effort
changed the critical incidence rate. Isthere evidence that the critical incidence rate
improved
